# Pan-cancer immune deconvolution and survival meta-analysis (P01)

**Theme:** T1 Pan-cancer transcriptomics | **Year:** 2025

## RQ
How do inferred immune cell proportions relate to survival across TCGA cancers?

## Hypothesis
Higher CD8+ T and dendritic proportions predict improved survival; suppressive myeloid states predict worse outcomes.

## Methods
MuSiC/BayesPrism; DESeq2/edgeR; Cox models

## Datasets
TCGA (GDC); recount3 (bulk); HCA/TISCH refs
